To get started with TanStack Query or React Query,

1. Install TanStack Query: npm install @tanstack/react-query

2. Set up the Query Client:

   To use TanStack Query, you need to wrap your app with the QueryClientProvider and pass a QueryClient instance.
   This is typically done in your root component (i.e main.tsx here).

   In main.tsx / main.jsx ( depends if youre using TypeScript or JavaScript)

   import .......... // wtv imports required
   import {QueryClient, QueryClientProvider} from "@tanstack/react-query";

   // Create a new query client instance
   const queryClient = new QueryClient();

   ReactDOM.render(
    <QueryClientProvider>  //Wraping out App with quieryClientProvider
    <App/>
    </QueryClientProvider>
    document.getElementById('root')
   )

3. Use a Query in a Component:
  
   Now that your query client in set up you can begin querying data in your components.
   

   const AnyComponent = () => {

    const {data,error,isLoading,refetch, isPending} = useQuery({
        queryKey = ['data'],
        queryFn = fetchData
    })
   }

Key Parts of useQuery:

useQuery accepts at least two arguments:

1. Query Key (['data'] in the example): A unique key to identify the query, which allows caching and re-fetching.
   This can be a simple string or an array (if you want to parameterize your query).

2. Query Function (fetchData): A function that fetches the data. It can be any async function (like fetch or an API call).


CONCLUSION:

Thus, TanStack Query makes data fetching and caching seamless while providing powerful tools for handling asynchronous data in your components. 
You can further explore features like pagination, caching, background fetching, and more as your app grows.
